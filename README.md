Predicting Saturation Vapour Pressure Using Machine Learning Methods

This project is conducted as part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course at the University of Helsinki. It explores various machine learning methods to predict saturation vapour pressure using a set of molecular features based on the CheskoQ dataset. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model selection, and the application of various evaluation methods and metrics to identify the best-performing algorithms.
